### Hi there 👋

* 👩‍💻 I am a human being, not a human doing.
* 🌱 These days I'm learning on Mechanistic Interpretability and Interactive Data Visualization
* 🔭 Interested in learning more on Javascript and telling stories on the web.
* 👩‍🎓 Currently studying for my PhD in Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University, Australia.
* 🔍 I develop R packages (and mostly Shiny apps) to make life easier for me and love contributing to the R packages of others.
* 📫 You can reach me at my email or my Bluesky.
* ⚡ Fun fact about me: I still don't know how Kubernetes actually works even though I was tasked with managing an entire cluster.
